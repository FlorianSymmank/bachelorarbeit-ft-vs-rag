                    " The novel 's narrative is divided into three distinct strands . One is centred on Urania Cabral , a fictional Dominican character ; another deals with the conspirators involved in Trujillo 's assassination ; and the third focuses on Trujillo himself . The novel alternates between these storylines , and also jumps back and forth from 1961 to 1996 , with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo 's regime . \n",
                    " In the novel 's final chapters , the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency . The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the SIM , the failure of the coup , the rape of Urania , and the concessions made to Trujillo 's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country . The book ends as Urania prepares to return home , determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island . \n"

Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms . Small bony fishes are also eaten , along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod . Larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays . This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi . \n",

There are unsubstantiated reports that its range extends to southern Papua New Guinea . It is the least common of the several maskray species native to the region . This species is a bottom @-@ dweller that prefers habitats with fine sediment . It has been recorded from between 12 and 62 m ( 39 and 203 ft ) deep , and tends to be found farther away from shore than other maskrays in its range . \n",
                    " Like other stingrays , the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) produced by the mother . Mature females have a single functional ovary and uterus , on the left . Litter size is one or two ; the newborns measure 12 \u2013 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 \u2013 5 @.@ 5 in ) across .

It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky . The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone , aldehyde , imine , or enone to produce the corresponding 3 @-@ membered ring . The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry . The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins . \n",

The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications . It has seen use in a number of high @-@ profile total syntheses , as detailed below , and is generally recognized as a powerful transformative tool in the organic repertoire . \n",

                    " Elephanta caves are a network of sculpted caves located on Elephanta Island , or Gharapuri ( literally \" the city of caves \" ) in Mumbai Harbour , 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to the east of the city of Mumbai in the Indian state of Maharashtra . The island , located on an arm of the Arabian Sea , consists of two groups of caves \u2014 the first is a large group of five Hindu caves , the second , a smaller group of two Buddhist caves . The Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures , representing the Shaiva Hindu sect , dedicated to the Lord Shiva . \n",
                    " The Elephanta caves are \" of unknown date and attribution \" . Art historians have dated the caves in the range of late 5th to late 8th century AD . Archaeological excavations have unearthed a few Kshatrapa coins dated to 4th century AD . The known history is traced only to the defeat of Mauryan rulers of Konkan by the Badami Chalukyas emperor Pulakesi II ( 609 \u2013 642 ) in a naval battle , in 635 AD . Elephanta was then called Puri or Purika , and served as the capital of the Konkan Mauryas . Some historians attribute the caves to the Konkan Mauryas , dating them to the mid @-@ 6th century , though others refute this claim saying a relatively small kingdom like the Konkan Mauryas could not undertake \" an almost superhuman excavation effort , \" which was needed to carve the rock temples from solid rock and could not have the skilled labor to produce such \" high quality \" sculpture . \n",
                    " Elephanta Island , or Gharapuri , is about 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) east of the Apollo Bunder ( Bunder in Marathi means a \" pier for embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and goods \" ) on the Mumbai Harbour and 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) south of Pir Pal in Trombay . The island covers about 10 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) at high tide and about 16 km2 ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) at low tide . Gharapuri is small village on the south side of the island . The Elephanta Caves can be reached by a ferry from the Gateway of India , Mumbai , which has the nearest airport and train station . The cave is closed on Monday . \n"

                    " The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles . Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty . Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Markgraf sank at 16 : 45 . The British soldiers in the guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships ; they shot and killed Markgraf 's captain , Walter Schumann , who was in a lifeboat , and an enlisted man . In total , the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty @-@ one . The remaining crews , totaling some 1 @,@ 860 officers and enlisted men , were imprisoned . \n",
                    " Markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918 , days before the Armistice was to take effect . The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet . Scheer \u2014 by now the Grand Admiral ( Gro\u00dfadmiral ) of the fleet \u2014 intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy in order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany , despite the expected casualties . However , many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Th\u00fcringen and then on several other battleships , including Markgraf , mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . Informed of the situation , the Kaiser stated , \" I no longer have a navy . \" \n",
                    " After Germany 's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918 , Markgraf and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow . The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles . On 21 June 1919 , days before the treaty was signed , the commander of the interned fleet , Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships . Unlike most of the scuttled ships , Markgraf was never raised for scrapping ; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay . \n"

            ],
            "generated_answer": " It appears the airport faced problems with several factors due to its status as a public facility . First , it had access to a private sector that saw financial benefit from the city 's airport . This resulted in the city wanting to increase its revenue and make it accessible to all its residents , including the refugees . Second , the port served as a tourist attraction , which led to more tourists than could be kept busy with regular security and maintenance duties . Finally , many flights had priority routes to international destinations after the earthquake , making it difficult for the airport to manage the arrival and departure schedules of the remaining passengers . \nAs such , the airline was forced to reduce the number of\u822a\u73ed scheduled each day as a way to provide more relief and avoid service disruptions caused by high traffic levels . In response to the natural disasters that struck the country , airlines in Egypt also began providing additional services to local residents to help alleviate the strain on the airport . These efforts included allowing travelers to fly into the port for food and other essentials , as well as allowing them to bring their families to travel in large numbers together instead of trying to get off in a crowd . \n As of April 2010 , the Port @-@ au @-@Prince airport was one of the most popular tourist destinations in Egypt . Its facilities had seen growth in both demand and popularity over the past few years , resulting in a higher demand for airfare , especially during summer months . \nOne key factor causing this increase was a significant increase in tourism , particularly among Egyptians and visitors of other Middle East countries . The region is home to a diverse mix of religious and cultural traditions that had contributed to the unique blend of Arabic , Arabesque architecture and Mediterranean elements that formed the country 's history . \nAs a result , Egyptian citizens and tourists alike used the airport to easily get to and around these places . In addition to serving as a main gate for Egyptian and foreign tourists , the airport served as a place for locals to shop and play sports . \n \n Although the airport was not completely successful in addressing the problems experienced by its passengers , it proved to be a valuable tool for improving safety and providing better transportation options for the population of the city . After a period of rapid expansion and growth in the early 20th century , the port became a major center of commercial activity . It now serves as the focal point of the Port @-@ au @-@Prince area of Cairo and its surroundings . \n",

                    " The airport faced ongoing operational challenges , including a computer virus that shut down the automated luggage bomb @-@ scanning system in June 2007 . A study by the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) released in July 2007 found the airport unsafe , citing numerous spots where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checkpoints . \n",
                    " The US military acknowledged the non @-@ governmental organizations ' complaints concerning flight @-@ operations bias and promised improvement while noting that up to 17 January 600 emergency flights had landed and 50 were diverted ; by the first weekend of disaster operations diversions had been reduced to three on Saturday and two on Sunday . The airport was able to support 100 landings a day , up from the 35 a day that the airport gets during normal operation . A spokesman for the joint task force running the airport confirmed that though more flights were requesting landing slots , none were being turned away . \n",
                    " While the Port @-@ au @-@ Prince airport ramp has spaces for over a dozen airliners , in the days following the quake it sometimes served nearly 40 at once , creating serious delays . The supply backup at the airport was expected to ease as the apron management improved , and when the perceived need for heavy security diminished . Airport congestion was reduced further on 18 January when the United Nations and US forces formally agreed to prioritise humanitarian flights over security reinforcement . \n"

The text states that he became the head of the archaeology department at the University of London and worked with Professor Ian Hamilton in the\u7b79\u5907 of the London Archaeological Survey . In addition to his post at the University of London , he served on the Committee of the University College Literary Society and on a committee of the Institute of Archaeology . According to the text , he took part in a major diplomatic conflict that lasted until April 1946 and was not resolved . The text does not mention any other activities or events during this period . In July 1946 , wheeler was involved in the burning of a building by the British security forces near Allahabad ; according to the text , wheeler joined them without any prior notice . He was eventually released after a two @-@ day operation . \nAfter moving to Mumbai , wheeler returned to London in January 1947 , where he was appointed the head of the Archaeological Survey . The text states that wheeler worked closely with Dr. Hilda Smail , who became the first head of the archaeology department at the British Museum . After working for four years at the museum , wheeler was promoted to head of the Institute of Archaeology and then in 1950 led the Institution of Archaeology through its\u5408\u5e76 into the British Archaeological Institute . \nIn March 1954 , wheeler was appointed the head of the Archaeological Survey of South Africa ( ASOS ) . \nThe reference text provides some background information about the early days of wheeler's career , including his visit to Japan in 1929 , when he observed the construction of the Tokyo Imperial Palace and visited the Meiji Shrine . However , the text does not mention wheeler 's role as the founder of the University of Oxford Institute of Archaeology . \nBased on the text , wheeler is mentioned several times throughout the book , particularly in relation to his teaching and research . For example , wheeler is described as having been the pioneer of modern archaeology and has played an important role in the development of the archaeology of Britain . Similarly , wheeler is mentioned several times in relation to the field of archaeology as a whole . The text describes wheeler as a prominent figure among the scholars who have studied the archaeology of Britain , including Richard Burkin and John Wilkins , among others .

                    " Wheeler began studying for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies , which he attained in 1912 . During this period , he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost Gregory Foster , although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from \" a college in the truly academic sense [ into ] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man \" . It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney , a student then studying history at UCL , when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society . \n",
                    " Wheeler left Italy in November 1943 and returned to London . There , he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology , preparing it for its adoption of a new director , V. Gordon Childe , after the war . He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries , but was appointed the group 's representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology . He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge , and asked her to marry him . As she was a devout Roman Catholic , he officially converted to the religion , something which shocked many of his friends , who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith . He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship , the City of Exeter , in February 1944 . \n",
                    " Wheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities . He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey , complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him . He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence , and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu @-@ majority city unharmed . He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital , where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob . As India neared independence from the British Empire , the political situation had changed significantly ; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a high @-@ up position within the country 's governing establishment , and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave . \n"

                    " World War Z : An Oral History of the Zombie War ( 2006 ) is an apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks . The novel is a collection of individual accounts narrated by an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission , following the devastating global conflict against the zombie plague . Other passages record a decade @-@ long desperate struggle , as experienced by people of various nationalities . The personal accounts also describe the resulting social , political , religious , and environmental changes . \n",
                    " World War Z is a follow @-@ up to Brooks ' \" survival manual \" The Zombie Survival Guide ( 2003 ) , but its tone is much more serious . It was inspired by The Good War : An Oral History of World War Two ( 1984 ) by Studs Terkel , and by the zombie films of George A. Romero . Brooks used World War Z to comment on government ineptitude and American isolationism , while also examining survivalism and uncertainty . The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics . \n",
                    " In June 2006 , Paramount Studios secured the film rights for World War Z for Brad Pitt 's production company , Plan B Entertainment , to produce . The screenplay was written by J. Michael Straczynski , with Marc Forster directing and Pitt starring as the main character , UN employee Gerry Lane . Despite being the draft that got the film green @-@ lit , Straczynski 's script was tossed aside , so that production , which was to begin at the start of 2009 , was delayed while the script was completely re @-@ written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present , leaving behind much of the book 's premise to make it more of an action film . In a 2012 interview , Brooks claimed the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title . Filming commenced mid @-@ 2011 , and the film was released in June 2013 . \n"

After the earthquake , there were reports of violent outbreaks of violence , particularly in areas bordering neighboring Haiti . It was also mentioned that a group of pirates attacked a shipping port in Port au Prince that was in control of a major port in Montesquieu . As a result , the Haitian military launched a massive search and rescue mission in order to find missing survivors . This was assisted by the UN in providing humanitarian aid .
