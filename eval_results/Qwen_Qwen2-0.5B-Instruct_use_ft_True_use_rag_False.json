The skull is covered with numerous scales that help protect the eyes from water splashes . \n\nThe mouth is covered by two rows of teeth , one at each end . The nostrils are wide and large , and the pharynx is located on the base of the head . The eyes are located above the nasal cavity , and the pupils are large and dark blue . The lower part of the brain is very elongated , and contains many nerves , including those of the cerebrum , thalamus , and pons . The brain is divided into three lobes : the frontal lobe , occipital lobe , and temporal lobe . The neural network in the frontal lobe is responsible for processing visual information , while the other two lobes control motor functions . The cerebral cortex is responsible for all sensory information and decision making , as well as controlling motor movements . \n",

            "generated_answer": "The \"Johnson @-@ Corey @-@ Chaykovsky reaction \" is a chemical reaction that takes place between a hydroxyl group of a benzene ring ( C6H5CH3 ) and a carbonyl group ( C = O ) , resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid derivative . The reaction is named after Robert J. Johnson , William M. Corey , and Charles F. Chaykovsky , who discovered it in 1907 . This reaction is a key step in the synthesis of ketones and derivatives of alkenes from cycloalkanes by using the double bond as a link between two carbon atoms . It was first reported by Henry R. Johnson in 1872 , who noticed that the double bonds on the carbonyl group of benzene ( CH3CH2CH2C\u2261C ) could be replaced with any other carbonyl group , which he called \" a new type of substituent \" . He found that this substitution would give rise to a wide variety of compounds . In 1882 , he and others were able to show that the double bond can be replaced with any of a number of different carbonyls : \n \nIn 1911 , Robert B. H. Johnson and his colleagues published a paper showing that the reaction could be carried out without any use of oxygen . They suggested that the mechanism involved the formation of a dihydrobenzene @-@ arylation product , but this was later confirmed by subsequent studies . \n\nThe original method for the reaction was to introduce the double bond into the carbonyl group of the benzene through the action of a catalyst . Since the reaction did not involve the addition of water , no solvent was required , making it suitable for laboratory work . However , the reaction also gave off heat and light . \n",
