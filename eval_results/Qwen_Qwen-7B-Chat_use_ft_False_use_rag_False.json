Some of its main characteristics include:\n\n  * A flattened body with a broad, flat tail and paddle-like pectoral fins\n  * A large mouth with numerous teeth\n  * Dark gray or brown skin with white spots\n  * A flat, triangular-shaped head with a small snout and round eyes\n  * No internal skeleton (hence the term \"cartilaginous\" fish)\n\nHabitat: The plain maskray is typically found in shallow coastal waters near reefs, estuaries, and mangrove swamps. It prefers areas with sandy or muddy bottoms where it can bury itself in the sediment to avoid predators. In some regions, it may also be found in brackish water or freshwater habitats.\n",

During World War I, it served as part of the High Seas Fleet and played a significant role in several major naval battles, including the Battle of Jutland in 1916. In this battle, SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max engaged in fierce combat with British battlecruisers and helped to hold their advance for a time. The ship was ultimately sunk by British destroyers in May 1917 after being struck by multiple shells.\n",

This reaction is named after its discoverers, C.B. Johnson, H.R. Corey, and N.M. Chaykovsky. The product of this reaction is an amine and an alcohol. It is a useful method for the preparation of primary and secondary amines, which are important intermediates in various organic reactions such as the Strecker synthesis, the Schlenk equilibrium, and the reduction of imines.\n",

Honor your father and your mother.\n6. You shall not murder.\n7. You shall not commit adultery.\n8. You shall not steal.\n9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n10.

By following these commandments, we can strive to become better people and live more fulfilling lives.\n",
