Rockefeller, who purchased land for $35 per acre. Since then, it has become known as one of the wealthiest towns in the United States, with a population of over 20,000 people. \n\nHistorically, Lock Haven has been a major agricultural center, producing wheat, corn, and other crops.

The poem was likely written during the Romantic era, which was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism. It is possible that Keats may have been inspired by the natural world around him or his own experiences as a poet. Without further proof, it would be difficult to determine where John Keats actually wrote the poem.",
