This\u6c22\u539f\u5b50 acts as a center of attraction between the central and outer atoms . When the hydrogen atom is replaced by one of its own electrons with a neighboring atom that has a different atomic charge , the electron becomes paired with the remaining electron on the central atom , which gives rise to a transition from a nonvalent dimer structure to a nonlunar dimer structure . \n",

The first site was found by a team from the University of California , San Diego in 1982 . Since then several more sites have been identified , and there is evidence suggesting that the area may have been occupied for thousands of years by various cultures . The most well established theory among these is that the images depict scenes from ancient Sumerian mythology and were created during Mesopotamian times ; the drawings are often associated with the gods of Mesopotamia , including the god Umaric , the god Akkadian Yonotani and the god Shatish. \n",

It is characterized by the absence of an adequate platelet count or a low neutrophil count as well as an increase in white cell count and decreased lymphocytes . \nThe most common presentation for AML is an expansion of blood vessels through multiple marrow beds with characteristic involvement of red blood cells in all three sets of territories. This is accompanied by the formation of a large infiltrative immune response . The patient may also develop haematosis of hair and nails due to autoimmune reactions in these tissues . \nIn addition to symptoms , AMLs also display abnormal hemolysis patterns such as a rapid destruction of platelets during the blood clotting reaction , increased levels of plasma proteins in both hemoglobin and albumin , an elevated white blood cell count and increased red cell counts from neutrophils , and an increased production of erythropoietin @-@ like protein which increases\u9aa8 marrow\u7684\u6570\u91cf . \nThe patient will usually require therapy based on the type of blastocytoma . AAMLs often receive oral chemotherapy using vorontuzumab ( NVPZB613 ) or rituximab ( LIMR284759 ) . For adults , rituximab and/or other small @-@ molecule anti @-@ cancer drugs can be used , while chemotherapy is considered best for children with AML due to its ability to slow down growth . \nWhen appropriate , stem cell transplantation can be performed after a diagnosis has been made for AML . \nNote : \n * AMLs are not treated with radiation in the United States \n * The disease is difficult to diagnose \n",

The United States President James Madison described it in 1783 : \n... I had long imagined a world which was similar to our own in its social structure , but also different from ours in the way in which society lived . \n...\nThis idea , with Galveston being at first perceived as an isolated , isolated island on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , has been seen through time by various authors who saw it as a reminder of the greatness of humanity , as well as a warning against human sin . \n...\nOther quotes have appeared more generally throughout history . One example of such a quote is from Charles Dickens ' The Man Who Could Dream ( 1846 ) . In this novel , we see a young man named George MacKinsey trying to convince his father of the value of a \" new life \" by suggesting he could become an artist . His father replies that Galveston is \" too far away \" , and George 's father tells him that Galveston is \" like home \" . This line of dialogue suggests the idea that people are accustomed to thinking of Galveston as isolated , and would find no meaning in what they think is a city so much like home . \n... \nSource",

            "generated_answer": "The Ten Commandments of Christianity ( Latin : Deity @-@ Catedralis Dei ) , written by Jesus Christ as a list of his commandments for the Christian faith , were outlined in several legal documents , known today as the Golden Rule . These commands have been interpreted in various ways throughout history and have served as a basis for religious practice . Some people believe that they are specific instructions given by God to Jesus Christ while others reject them as a literal interpretation of divine inspiration ; they have been widely criticized by many Christians as being a misinterpretation of Jesus ' message . The texts have remained a source of debate among theologians , and opinions vary from person to person about which passages they consider to be relevant or authoritative . Many religious leaders who study the text believe that it serves as a foundation for the Christian ethic , as it provides guidelines on how to act according to one 's beliefs . In modern times , the Ten Commandments continue to be part of the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church , but they have been largely modified to reflect changes in Christian thought since 1980 . \n",

The first type was the Merlin , built between 1936 and 1945 . It featured the modern wing layout used in France in the First World War with a single engine and four 21 @.@ 8 inch ( 50 cm ) swept pitch engines , each operating from either side of the fuselage for maximum efficiency . The second type of aircraft , the Fowling , which I assume to be based on the same design as the Merlin , entered production in August 1945 . This machine had twin 1 @-@ element jet engines , each capable of 20 @-@ hour cruise speeds and a range of 30 miles ( 50 km ) . However , its performance at sea was poor due to lack of supersonic capability . \n",

My knowledge cut off date is April 19 , 2017 . \nThe event was believed to have begun when a large earthquake hit the island of Madagascar as a result of a tropical cyclone before it entered the Indian Ocean , causing widespread damage and loss of life . The aftermath of the 2013 earthquake was so devastating that many small islands were completely destroyed and many lives lost . \nHowever , little information exists about what happened beyond this time frame , and where some of these events may occur today . It would be interesting to know more details about what occurred in Petit Paradis during the 2013 earthquake and how it has affected the island since then . \nIf you provide more specific details about the incident , I will be happy to assist you further with your request.",
