Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Wound Taken for Someone 's Sake ) , it was originally released through PlayStation Network and Qriocity between April and May 2011 . The initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to PSN during the early summer of that year . It later released for DVD on June 29 and August 31 , 2011 , with separate \" Black \" and \" Blue \" editions being available for purchase . The anime is set during the latter half of Valkyria Chronicles III , detailing a mission by the Nameless against their Imperial rivals Calamity Raven . The anime was first announced in November 2010 . It was developed by A @-@ 1 Pictures , produced by Shinji Motoyama , directed by Nobuhiro Kond\u014d , and written by Hiroshi \u014cnogi . Sakimoto 's music for the game was used in the anime . \n",
                    " The novel 's narrative is divided into three distinct strands . One is centred on Urania Cabral , a fictional Dominican character ; another deals with the conspirators involved in Trujillo 's assassination ; and the third focuses on Trujillo himself . The novel alternates between these storylines , and also jumps back and forth from 1961 to 1996 , with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo 's regime . \n",
                    " In the novel 's final chapters , the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency . The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the SIM , the failure of the coup , the rape of Urania , and the concessions made to Trujillo 's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country . The book ends as Urania prepares to return home , determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island . \n"

                    " The plain maskray generally hunts at the surface of the bottom substrate , rather than digging for prey . Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms . Small bony fishes are also eaten , along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod . Larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays . This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi . \n",
                    " The plain maskray inhabits the continental shelf of northern Australia from the Wellesley Islands in Queensland to the Bonaparte Archipelago in Western Australia , including the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Timor and Arafura Seas . There are unsubstantiated reports that its range extends to southern Papua New Guinea . It is the least common of the several maskray species native to the region . This species is a bottom @-@ dweller that prefers habitats with fine sediment . It has been recorded from between 12 and 62 m ( 39 and 203 ft ) deep , and tends to be found farther away from shore than other maskrays in its range . \n",
                    " Like other stingrays , the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) produced by the mother . Mature females have a single functional ovary and uterus , on the left . Litter size is one or two ; the newborns measure 12 \u2013 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 \u2013 5 @.@ 5 in ) across . Males and females reach sexual maturity at disc widths of 20 \u2013 21 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 \u2013 8 @.@ 3 in ) and 18 \u2013 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 \u2013 7 @.@ 5 in ) respectively .

This reaction is named after James Henry Thayer , who first described it in 1840 , and is named after his son Henry J. Corey , who is credited with developing it in 1873 . \n\nIn the reaction mechanism , the reaction is catalyzed by a nucleophile , which is activated by the presence of a metal catalyst . The main products produced are the corresponding alkene and alkyne derivatives ; these can be further transformed into various other compounds through further oxidation or reduction processes . The reaction was first published in 1885 by John Henry Johnson and then rediscovered and expanded upon by J. J. Corey and M. C. Chaykovsky in 1930 . The reactions were later extended by others , including E. J. Corey , R. A. D. Chaykovsky , W. A. P. Smith , and S. T. F. Lister . \n\nIn 1961 , A. W. Johnson and colleagues at the University of California , Berkeley , USA , synthesized the first synthetic epoxide by using the reaction . The authors used a mixture of pyridine and thiol groups to react with the sulfur ylide , resulting in the formation of the first known epoxide . In 1962 , the reaction was improved by adding an additional thiol group to the substrate , producing the first epoxide . In 1964 , another team from MIT , under the supervision of Paul R. Klenow , reported the synthesis of a new class of epoxide , called the \" Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction \" . \n\nAs of 2016 , the Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction remains one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis . The reaction is also widely used in a variety of industrial applications , including the production of various organic pesticides , insecticides , and fungicides . \n",

                    " The Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction ( sometimes referred to as the Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction or CCR ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides , aziridines , and cyclopropanes . It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky . The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone , aldehyde , imine , or enone to produce the corresponding 3 @-@ membered ring . The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry . The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins . \n",
                    " The application of the Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse . The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications .

                    " Elephanta caves are a network of sculpted caves located on Elephanta Island , or Gharapuri ( literally \" the city of caves \" ) in Mumbai Harbour , 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to the east of the city of Mumbai in the Indian state of Maharashtra . The island , located on an arm of the Arabian Sea , consists of two groups of caves \u2014 the first is a large group of five Hindu caves , the second , a smaller group of two Buddhist caves . The Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures , representing the Shaiva Hindu sect , dedicated to the Lord Shiva . \n",
                    " The Elephanta caves are \" of unknown date and attribution \" . Art historians have dated the caves in the range of late 5th to late 8th century AD . Archaeological excavations have unearthed a few Kshatrapa coins dated to 4th century AD . The known history is traced only to the defeat of Mauryan rulers of Konkan by the Badami Chalukyas emperor Pulakesi II ( 609 \u2013 642 ) in a naval battle , in 635 AD . Elephanta was then called Puri or Purika , and served as the capital of the Konkan Mauryas . Some historians attribute the caves to the Konkan Mauryas , dating them to the mid @-@ 6th century , though others refute this claim saying a relatively small kingdom like the Konkan Mauryas could not undertake \" an almost superhuman excavation effort , \" which was needed to carve the rock temples from solid rock and could not have the skilled labor to produce such \" high quality \" sculpture . \n",
                    " Elephanta Island , or Gharapuri , is about 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) east of the Apollo Bunder ( Bunder in Marathi means a \" pier for embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and goods \" ) on the Mumbai Harbour and 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) south of Pir Pal in Trombay . The island covers about 10 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) at high tide and about 16 km2 ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) at low tide . Gharapuri is small village on the south side of the island . The Elephanta Caves can be reached by a ferry from the Gateway of India , Mumbai , which has the nearest airport and train station . The cave is closed on Monday . \n"

It was the last major naval battle of the conflict until the Battle of Jutland in September 1918 , when the battleship Hohenzollern captured the battleship H.M.S. Graf Spee . \n\nReuter had hoped to capture the German battleships in the hope of preventing them from using their ships to attack Britain and the United States , but instead the two fleets engaged each other in a series of engagements off the Danish and Norwegian coastlines . By the time the battle began , both sides had reached the same point of the battle line near the entrance to the Barentine Straits , where they were separated by the strait . The British forces , under the command of Rear Admiral Sir David Haldane , were attempting to cut off the supply lines to the German ships , while the American forces , led by Admiral Robert Cushing , were trying to secure a landing on the Danish island of Zealand . \n",

                    " The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles . Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty . Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Markgraf sank at 16 : 45 . The British soldiers in the guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships ; they shot and killed Markgraf 's captain , Walter Schumann , who was in a lifeboat , and an enlisted man . In total , the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty @-@ one . The remaining crews , totaling some 1 @,@ 860 officers and enlisted men , were imprisoned . \n",
                    " Markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918 , days before the Armistice was to take effect . The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet . Scheer \u2014 by now the Grand Admiral ( Gro\u00dfadmiral ) of the fleet \u2014 intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy in order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany , despite the expected casualties . However , many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Th\u00fcringen and then on several other battleships , including Markgraf , mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . Informed of the situation , the Kaiser stated , \" I no longer have a navy . \" \n",
                    " After Germany 's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918 , Markgraf and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow . The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles . On 21 June 1919 , days before the treaty was signed , the commander of the interned fleet , Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships . Unlike most of the scuttled ships , Markgraf was never raised for scrapping ; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay . \n"

This system uses radar cameras to identify suspicious individuals and vehicles and automatically alerts airport staff if there are any illegal activity . Additionally , the airport also added additional security guards , expanded the number of gates and upgraded security personnel , and installed surveillance cameras across the terminal . As a result of these improvements , the airport reported a 9 @-@ 10 increase in passenger traffic compared to the previous year . In addition , the airport has seen a drop in the number of unauthorized entry attempts , with 25 incidents reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared to 15 in the same period in 2010 . \n",

The context does not provide enough information about Wheeler's background and career to accurately answer this question. However, we can infer that Wheeler may have moved to England after returning from India due to dissatisfaction with the government policies there. \n\nThe passage states that Wheeler left Italy in 1912 and went to study for a Master of Arts degree at the University of London, but later became disillusioned with the institution and left before graduating in 1918. This indicates that he likely moved to England to pursue other interests such as archaeology and travel instead of pursuing a formal education in Britain. Additionally, the passage mentions that he was married to a woman named Kim Collingridge, but does not mention any significant changes in his romantic relationships while abroad. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine what specific location Wheeler moved to after leaving the Hallam Street flat. \n\nTherefore, given the lack of information provided, it is not possible to definitively identify Wheeler's final destination. Additional details would be needed to make a more accurate assessment of his whereabouts after his departure from London.",

                    " Wheeler began studying for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies , which he attained in 1912 . During this period , he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost Gregory Foster , although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from \" a college in the truly academic sense [ into ] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man \" . It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney , a student then studying history at UCL , when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society . \n",
                    " Wheeler left Italy in November 1943 and returned to London . There , he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology , preparing it for its adoption of a new director , V. Gordon Childe , after the war . He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries , but was appointed the group 's representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology . He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge , and asked her to marry him . As she was a devout Roman Catholic , he officially converted to the religion , something which shocked many of his friends , who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith . He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship , the City of Exeter , in February 1944 . \n",
                    " Wheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities . He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey , complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him . He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence , and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu @-@ majority city unharmed . He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital , where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob . As India neared independence from the British Empire , the political situation had changed significantly ; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a high @-@ up position within the country 's governing establishment , and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave . \n"

The Mitchells were primarily used for anti @-@ ground attacks and were used for transport , with some aircraft being assigned to the 1st Light Fighter Wing . \n\nIn January 1945 , No. 79 Wing began to receive new aircraft , including the Focke Wulf Fw 200 and Fw 190 fighters . This included a number of newly acquired Fw 190 fighters , which had been sent from England for training . On 21 February , the 79th Fighter Squadron became operational with the 190s , and on 2 March , the 2nd and 14th Light Fighter Squadrons joined it . The 79th also received the first Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft , which was delivered from France in April 1945 . In August , the squadron underwent a major refit , replacing the old Hurricanes with the Hawker Typhoon and Fokker D .4U . In October , the squadron was redesignated as the 79th Reconnaissance Wing , with the 190s taking over as the primary bomber squadrons . \n\nThe 79th also operated several other aircraft : two Focke Wulf Fw 190s , one Fw 190 / Kf 109 , one Fw 190 , three Fw 190 / KF 100s , and three Fw 190 / KF 111s . \n",

                    " No. 79 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) wing of World War II . It was formed in December 1943 at Batchelor , Northern Territory , as part of North @-@ Western Area Command . Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton , the wing comprised four squadrons on its establishment , flying Beaufort and B @-@ 25 Mitchell bombers and Beaufighter heavy fighters . No. 79 Wing took part in the New Guinea and North @-@ Western Area Campaigns during 1944 \u2013 45 , eventually transferring to Balikpapan in the Dutch East Indies as the Allies advanced northward . By the end of the Pacific War , the wing was attached to the Australian First Tactical Air Force and was made up of Nos. 2 and 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadrons , both flying Mitchells . The latter transferred to the Netherlands Air Force in late 1945 , while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year . No. 79 Headquarters itself disbanded in October 1945 , soon after the end of hostilities . \n",
                    " No. 79 Wing was established at Batchelor , Northern Territory , on 30 November 1943 . Its combat units consisted of Nos. 1 and 2 Squadrons ( flying Beaufort light reconnaissance bombers ) , No. 31 Squadron ( Beaufighter long @-@ range fighters ) , and No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron ( B @-@ 25 Mitchell medium bombers ) . The wing was commanded by Group Captain Charles Eaton , whose Dutch personnel called him \" Oom Charles \" ( Uncle Charles ) . Operating under the auspices of North @-@ Western Area Command ( NWA ) , Darwin , No. 79 Wing participated in the New Guinea and North @-@ Western Area Campaigns during 1944 . \n",
                    " In June \u2013 July 1944 , No. 79 Wing supported the Allied attack on Noemfoor . No. 18 Squadron was again the wing 's most active unit , flying 107 sorties . In September , the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in Ceram and Celebes , but lost nine aircraft and twenty @-@ six crewmen killed , among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett , son of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation manager Lawrence Wackett . By the end of the month , Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained . In late 1944 , plans were made to transfer No. 79 Wing from North @-@ Western Area Command to Northern Command in Papua New Guinea , where it would undertake operations against the Japanese in New Britain . The wing 's composition for this move was to be Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons , operating Mitchells , and 120 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron , operating P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks . No. 31 Squadron was transferred from No. 79 Wing to the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai in December . The same month , Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced by Group Captain John Ryland . \n"

                    " World War Z : An Oral History of the Zombie War ( 2006 ) is an apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks . The novel is a collection of individual accounts narrated by an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission , following the devastating global conflict against the zombie plague . Other passages record a decade @-@ long desperate struggle , as experienced by people of various nationalities . The personal accounts also describe the resulting social , political , religious , and environmental changes . \n",
                    " World War Z is a follow @-@ up to Brooks ' \" survival manual \" The Zombie Survival Guide ( 2003 ) , but its tone is much more serious . It was inspired by The Good War : An Oral History of World War Two ( 1984 ) by Studs Terkel , and by the zombie films of George A. Romero . Brooks used World War Z to comment on government ineptitude and American isolationism , while also examining survivalism and uncertainty . The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics . \n",
                    " In June 2006 , Paramount Studios secured the film rights for World War Z for Brad Pitt 's production company , Plan B Entertainment , to produce . The screenplay was written by J. Michael Straczynski , with Marc Forster directing and Pitt starring as the main character , UN employee Gerry Lane . Despite being the draft that got the film green @-@ lit , Straczynski 's script was tossed aside , so that production , which was to begin at the start of 2009 , was delayed while the script was completely re @-@ written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present , leaving behind much of the book 's premise to make it more of an action film . In a 2012 interview , Brooks claimed the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title . Filming commenced mid @-@ 2011 , and the film was released in June 2013 . \n"

Communication systems , air , land , and sea transport facilities , hospitals , and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake , which hampered rescue and aid efforts ; confusion over who was in charge , air traffic congestion , and problems with prioritisation of flights further complicated early relief work . Port @-@ au @-@ Prince 's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies . These had to be buried in mass graves . As rescues tailed off , supplies , medical care and sanitation became priorities . Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors , and looting and sporadic violence were observed . On 22 January the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close , and on the following day the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors . \n",
                    " The quake created a landslide dam on the Rivi\u00e8re de Grand Go\u00e2ve . As of February 2010 the water level was low , but engineer Yves Gattereau believed the dam could collapse during the rainy season , which would flood Grand @-@ Go\u00e2ve 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) downstream . \n"

He may have been inspired by the nightingale's song while visiting the home of William Wordsworth at the time , possibly in his early twenties . \nBased on the context provided, it seems that the nightingale that inspired Keats to compose \" Ode to a Nightingale \" was likely a specific type of nightingale known as a nightingale @-@ singing owl . This type of owl is native to Britain and Europe , but has not yet been documented in the United States . Therefore , there is no evidence to support the claim that \" Ode to a Nightingale \" was actually written in the garden of the Spaniards Inn in Hampstead . \n\nHowever , the poem does mention that a nightingale once built a nest nearby in the garden of Keats 's house in Hampstead , and this could be considered the inspiration for \" Ode to a Nightingale \" . Without additional information about the exact location where the nightingale was built , it is impossible to say if the poem was indeed written in the garden of the Spaniards Inn , or if it was later added to the garden of Keats 's own house . The poem itself describes the nightingale building its nest in the garden of the house that the poet lived in during his stay in London , and the nightingale 's song served as a metaphor for the poet 's relationship with his former lover , Emily Dickinson .",

                    " \" Ode to a Nightingale \" is a poem by John Keats written either in the garden of the Spaniards Inn , Hampstead , London or , according to Keats ' friend Charles Armitage Brown , under a plum tree in the garden of Keats ' house at Wentworth Place , also in Hampstead . According to Brown , a nightingale had built its nest near the house Keats and Brown shared in the spring of 1819 . Inspired by the bird 's song , Keats composed the poem in one day . It soon became one of his 1819 odes and was first published in Annals of the Fine Arts the following July . \n",
