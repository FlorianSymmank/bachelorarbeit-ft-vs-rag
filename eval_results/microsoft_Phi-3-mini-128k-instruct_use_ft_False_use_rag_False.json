            "generated_answer": "The plain maskray (Acipenser sturio) is a species of ray in the family Acipenseridae. It is characterized by its large size, with a disc width of up to 1.5 meters, and a flattened body adapted for bottom-dwelling. The plain maskray has a distinctive snout with a large, flat, and often ornamented disc, which is used for digging in the substrate. It has a long, whip-like tail with a venomous spine. The coloration of the plain maskray is typically mottled gray or brown, with a lighter underside.\n\nThe plain maskray inhabits the brackish and freshwater environments of the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly in the estuaries and coastal areas of Europe and western Russia. They prefer soft, muddy bottoms with plenty of vegetation and can be found in depths ranging from 1 to 20 meters. They are bottom-dwellers and spend most of their time buried in the sediment, emerging only to feed on benthic invertebrates such as worms, crustaceans, and mollusks. The plain maskray is a solitary species and is known to be elusive, making it difficult to study in the wild.",

Delays and cost overruns: The construction of the airport faced significant delays and cost overruns, with the final cost exceeding the initial budget by billions of baht.\n\n2. Infrastructure issues: The airport's infrastructure, including roads, public transportation, and hotels, was not fully developed to accommodate the expected number of passengers and visitors.\n\n3. Security concerns: The airport faced security concerns, particularly after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which led to increased security measures and protocols.\n\n4. Environmental impact: The construction and operation of the airport had a significant impact on the surrounding environment, including deforestation, habitat destruction, and air and noise pollution.\n\n5. Management and operational issues: The airport's management and operational systems faced challenges, including staffing shortages, inadequate training, and inefficient processes.\n\n6. Competition: Suvarnabhumi Airport faced competition from other airports in the region, particularly Don Mueang International Airport, which continued to operate alongside the new airport.\n\n7. Passenger experience: The airport's design and layout faced criticism for being confusing and difficult to navigate, leading to negative passenger experiences.\n\n8. Political and social issues: The airport's construction and operation faced political and social opposition, particularly from local communities and environmental groups.\n\nDespite these challenges, Suvarnabhumi Airport has since become one of the busiest airports in Southeast Asia, with a strong focus on improving its infrastructure, security, and passenger experience.",

            "generated_answer": "The Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue, are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship, which play a fundamental role in Judaism and Christianity, including Catholicism. In Catholic theology, they are considered divine laws given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. They are significant as they form the basis of moral law and are seen as a guide for living a life pleasing to God. The Ten Commandments are:\n\n1. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me.\n2. You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them.\n3. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.\n4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work.\n5. Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.\n6. You shall not murder.\n7. You shall not commit adultery.\n8. You shall not steal.\n9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\n10. You shall not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor.\n\nThese commandments are considered the foundation of the moral and ethical teachings of the Catholic Church. They are seen as a reflection of God's love and mercy, and they guide Catholics in their daily lives, helping them to live in harmony with God and with others.",
